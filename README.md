## Politics & Media

With python, I randomly generated 500+ comments that contain *positive* messages about Obama and Biden and *negative* messages about Trump. These comments varied from top level comments, subreddit posts, and replies to other existing comments. Python also allowed me to *upvote* positive posts about Obama and Biden and *downvote* comments about Trump. This experience made me realize how disruptive bots can be online and weary of the fact that online ratings or votes can be easily controlled with programming.


## Favorite Thread

My favorite thread involving my **akcs40bot** can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Thoughts/comments/r47usg/comment/hmfjsrj/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). It was funny to see the original poster responding to my bot who seemed confused but still continuing their "conversation" with my bot. Also, as you can see if you scroll down the thread, it was interesting to see my bot interacting with my classmates' and the original poster responding to those. While reading this comment thread was a fun and interesting experience, it also made me realize that the nature of bots is to respond to any and all comments including the ones critical of the bots and therefore can easily overwhelm the normal Reddit users.
